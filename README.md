# CK3-Project-Tactica
Ongoing tinkering and work for a complete overhaul of combat, levies, and men-at-arms in CK3

# Current Ideas List

- Remove levies. All of them. Nuke the heck out of levies, and replace them all with Men-at-Arms.
- "Levy" MaA type now background- and terrain-dependent. E.g. steppe nomads will want light cavalry and/or horse archers as levies, sedentary folk will want light infantry and/or archers.
- Base regiment size is 25, MaA regiment cap starts at 4.
	- Levy buildings that would give +100 levy give +1 MaA slot instead.
	- Global levy size modifiers replaced with +X MaA regiment size modifiers.
- Possible specialist MaA types (beyond siege units):
	- Rear guard: does not take part in combat, but has high screen and/or pursuit with which it will help out during Phase 4.
	- Denial: has pretty poor stats, but good countering efficiencies. Dedicated to decreasing the damage output of certain opposing units instead of fighting normally.
- Add in special historical MaA types with their own icons:
	- Camel infantry (infantry who used camels to get around quickly)
	- Camel archers (archers who used camels to get around quickly)
	- Heavy horse archers (for ERE kavallarioi and Slavic druzhina)
	- Mounted crossbowmen (mainly in Europe)
	- Arquebus (extremely lategame, extremely expensive)
- Do a complete overhaul of the Strategist lifestyle perks and the Martial legacy, since both are intimately tied to combat stuff being overhauled (also touch on perks that are related to Knight efficiency and/or war profiteering).
- Find some replacement for vassal levies. Maybe something about MaA maintenance?
- Find some way to hook development into MaA. Maybe average development dictates MaA maintenance or general combat efficiency?
- Introduce innovations, buildings, etc. that make use of weird modifiers that can be applied to the entire realm, e.g. adjusting minimum combat rolls or negating terrain penalties but only in friendly terrain.
