## Combat defines
#
NCombat = {
	COMBAT_EVENT_DAYS = 6					# Vanilla = 5. Changed to be a multiple of phase duration (3 days).
	BASE_WIDTH_RATIO = 2					# Vanilla = 1. Changed to lessen inherent defender's advantage from numbers.
	MEN_AT_ARMS_MAX_COUNTER = 0.8			# Vanilla = 0.9. Changed to 0.8 to make calculating fractions easier.
	MEN_AT_ARMS_COUNTER_MODIFICATION = 5	# Vanilla = 6. Changed to 5 to make it line up with standard Advantage modifiers.
	BASE_TOUGHNESS_TO_PURSUIT = 0.2			# Vanilla = 0.05. Changed to 0.2 to make retreats deadlier by default.

#
## Logistics defines
#

	DISEMBARK_PENALTY_DAYS = 14				# Vanilla = 30. Changed to 14 because 2 weeks makes more sense and would fit within the timeframe of the Battle of Hastings (William disembarked on 28 Sep., battle happened on 14 Oct.).
	UNRAISED_LEVY_REGIMENTS_SPEED = 5.4		# Vanilla = 40.0. Changed to match Retreat speed (4.5) inside friendly territory (+20%). Note that this has no effect on men-at-arms.
}

NArmy = {
	REGIMENT_MONTHLY_REINFORCE_SPEED = 0.025		# Vanilla = 0.03. Reduced to match REGIMENT_MONTHLY_MAA_REINFORCE_SPEED.
	REGIMENT_MONTHLY_MAA_REINFORCE_SPEED = 0.025	# Vanilla = 0.1. Reduced to match slowest reinforce rate for retinues in vanilla CK2, also to get to a similar reinforce speed as HIP in CK2.

#
## Levy stats
#

	GOLD_COST_PER_SOLDIER = 0.01	# Vanilla = 0.003. While levies will get disabled in the mod, it's still worth dialing up their maintenance costs in case of any mods that might need them and/or in case we can't eliminate them completely. This cost is now in line with 1/3 Skirmisher MaA costs.

#
## Men-at-Arms stats
#

	REGIMENT_DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE = 25			# Vanilla = 100. 25 makes it easier to tweak numbers with holding buildings.
	REGIMENT_DEFAULT_MAX_SIZE = 4 				# Vanilla = 3. This makes the default value of a MaA slot = 100 soldiers.
	REGIMENT_MAA_CAP_BY_TIER = { 0 1 2 3 4 5 }	# Vanilla = { 0 1 2 3 4 5 }. Here for posterity, in case I change my mind about how MaA slots should work
	REGIMENT_MAA_EXTRA_BY_CAP = 0.25			# Vanilla = 0.2. Needs to a bit higher because dipping below the cap would be much easier.
	REGIMENT_MAA_STARTING_COUNT = 25			# Vanilla = 5. First stack starts completely filled. Being able to cheese this to get free MaA quickly if you've run out is intended because of the massive gold cost involved; you might as well hire mercenaries instead.
}

#
## Knight stats
#

NCombat = {
	KNIGHT_DAMAGE_PER_PROWESS = 25			# Vanilla = 100. 25 means that Prowess 10 character would have a Damage equal to the highest statted MaA in the game, the War Elephant.
	KNIGHT_TOUGHNESS_PER_PROWESS = 5		# Vanilla = 10. 5 means that Prowess 10 character would have a Toughness equal to the highest statted MaA in the game, the War Elephant.
}

#
## Mercenary stats
#

NMercenary = {
	LEVIES = { 0 0 0 }						# Vanilla = { 400 800 1200 }. No more levies!
	MAA_REGIMENTS = { 2 3 4 } 				# Vanilla = { 1 2 3 }. Mercenaries are hardcoded to pick different regiments for each one, so just increase all values by 1 to account for levies being a new MaA type.
	NUM_KNIGHTS = { 2 4 6 } 				# Vanilla = { 2 3 4 }. Knight count now grows at the same rate as men-at-arms count.
	MAA_REGIMENT_SIZES = { 350 500 600 }	# Vanilla = { 300 300 300 }. This is the actual regiment cap that mercenaries will have per MaA type.
	LEVY_COST_PER_100_SOLDIERS = 24			# Vanilla = 12. Parity with light_infantry_recruitment_cost and MAA_COST_RATIO.
	MAA_COST_RATIO = 2.0					# Vanilla = 0.5. MaA costs being less on the up-front side and more on the reinforce side means this can be raised.
	ALLOWED_DEBT_MONTHS = 3					# Vanilla = 24. 3 months in debt allows for a minor amount of leeway (more than e.g. 1 month), but we still don't want people to hire mercs easily if they don't have enough gold.
	REINFORCEMENT_FACTOR = 2.0				# Vanilla = 3.0. Makes merc reinforce rates be equal to CK2 retinues' at highest cost setting.
}

#
## Holy Order stats
#

NHolyOrder = {
	NUM_LEVIES_BASE = 0					# Vanilla = 500. No more levies!
	NUM_LEVIES_PER_HOLDING = 0			# Vanilla = 200. No more levies!
	NUM_MAA_BASE = 700					# Vanilla = 200. Compensates for NUM_LEVIES_BASE setting.
	NUM_MAA_PER_HOLDING = 300			# Vanilla = 100. Compensates for NUM_LEVIES_PER_HOLDING setting.
	RELIGION_MAA_RATIO = 0.3			# Vanilla = 0.7. Compensates for NUM_LEVIES_BASE setting.
	LEVY_COST_PER_100_SOLDIERS = 6		# Vanilla = 5.0. Parity with light_infantry_recruitment_cost and MAA_COST_RATIO.
	MAA_COST_RATIO = 0.5				# Vanilla = 0.2. MaA costs being less on the up-front side and more on the reinforce side means this can be raised.
	PATRON_HIRE_COST_MULT = 0.2			# Vanilla = 0. Prevents troops from being *completely* free, which would be highly abusable.
