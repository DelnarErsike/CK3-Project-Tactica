# Combat

- Base combat width is now 2x the defender's army size (from 1x).
- Max men-at-arms counter effect is now -80% (from -90%).
- Countered men-at-arms get -5 advantage (from -6).
- The base conversion of soft casualties to hard casualties during a retreat is now 20% of a retreating army's Toughness (from 5%).

# Logistics

- Disembark penalty now lasts 14 days (from 30).
- Unraised levies now move at a speed of 5.4 per day (from 40).
- Levies and men-at-arms both now reinforce at 2.5% per month (from 3% and 10% per month respectively).

# Knights

- Knight combat events happen every 6 days (from 5).
- Knights now get 25 Damage and 5 Toughness per Prowess (from 100 and 10 respectively).
- Characters need to have a Prowess of 9 or higher to be knights.

# Mercenaries

- Medium- and large-sized mercenary companies now spawn with 4 knights and 6 knights respectively (from 3 and 4 respectively).
- Mercenaries can now no longer be hired if a character is in debt by more than 3 months' worth of revenue (from 24).
- Mercenaries now reinforce twice as fast as normal troops (from three times as fast).

# Holy Orders

- Holy Order patrons now get an -80% hiring cost discount (from -100%).

# UI

- Unit quality thresholds are now set to strength-per-soldier ratios of 33, 57, 81, and 100 (from 25, 50, 75, and 100). These thresholds are a better representation of the N-square relationship of strength ratios in CK3.
- The combat predictor now only displays higher troop quality as an edge in one side's favor if the ratio of strength-per-soldier ratios is at least 1.47 (from 1.25). This threshold is a better representation of the N-square relationship of strength ratios in CK3, and is in line with the raw advantage of the 1.25 troop quantity ratio that CK3 uses for its predictor.
